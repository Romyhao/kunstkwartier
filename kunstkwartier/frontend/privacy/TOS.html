    <h1>Terms of Service for Kunstkwartiertje</h1>
    <p> Last updated 25/11/2025. By downloading, accessing, or using Kunstkwartiertje (“the app,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. <br> If you do not agree, you must not use the app. <br> You must be at least [age requirement, e.g., 13 or 18] or have legal guardian consent to use the app. <br> You are responsible for ensuring that your use complies with all applicable laws and regulations. <br> We grant you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the app for personal and lawful purposes. <br>
         You may not copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, sell, or exploit any part of the app unless expressly permitted in writing. <br> All content, trademarks, features, and intellectual property within the app remain the property of Vistacollege or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws. <br>
        You agree not to use the app in any manner that could harm, interfere with, or impair the app or other users, including attempting unauthorized access, transmitting harmful code, or using the app for fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activities. <br> If the app allows user-generated content, you are solely responsible for all content you submit and you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, display, and distribute such content as needed to operate the app. <br> We may remove content or restrict access at our discretion. <br>
        The app is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose, reliability, or availability. We do not guarantee that the app will be error-free, secure, uninterrupted, or free of harmful components. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the app, including loss of data, profits, or access, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the app is to discontinue use.
        If the app includes paid features or subscriptions, all purchases are subject to the pricing and billing terms provided at the time of purchase, and payments may be processed by third-party services. <br> Except where required by law, all fees are non-refundable. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the app or any features at any time without notice. <br> We may also update these Terms at our discretion, and changes take effect when posted within the app or on our website; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. <br>
        We may terminate or suspend your access without notice if you violate these Terms or if required by law. <br> Upon termination, your right to use the app ends immediately, and any provisions that should survive termination will continue to apply. <br> The app may contain links to third-party services for which we are not responsible and do not endorse. <br> These Terms are governed by the laws of The Netherlands, without regard to conflict of law principles, and any disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts of Maastricht, unless otherwise required by law. <br> If any part of these Terms is found invalid, the remaining sections remain in full effect.
       <br> If you have questions or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, please contact us at VistaCollege,  517899@vistacollege.nl.</p>
